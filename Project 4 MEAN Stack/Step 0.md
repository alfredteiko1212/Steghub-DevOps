# MEAN Stack Implementation

The MEAN stack is a popular full-stack JavaScript framework used for building dynamic web applications. It comprises four key technologies:

1. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, allowing for easy scaling and efficient data retrieval.

2. **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It facilitates the development of server-side logic and APIs.

3. **Angular**: A front-end framework developed by Google, which allows developers to build single-page applications (SPAs) using a component-based architecture. Angular's two-way data binding and dependency injection enhance the development process.

4. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling developers to execute JavaScript on the server side. Node.js allows for building scalable and high-performance applications with a non-blocking I/O model.

Together, these technologies provide a cohesive development environment that leverages JavaScript across both the client and server sides, simplifying the development process and improving collaboration between teams. The MEAN stack is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications, such as chat applications and collaborative tools.

# Step 0: Sign in to AWS and Launch an EC2 Instance
1. Log in to your AWS account.
   
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard and click on “Launch Instance.”

3. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), preferably an Ubuntu Server version.
    
4. Select an instance type based on your requirements (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
    
5. Configure instance details, add storage, and set up security groups (ensure that ports 22 and 3300 are open).

6. Review and launch the instance. After launching, make sure to SSH into your instance.

7. Open your terminal and connect to your EC2 instance using SSH. Replace your-key.pem and ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns with your actual key file and public DNS:

```
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
```
